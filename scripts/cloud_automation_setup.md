# Cloud Automation Setup (No Computer Required)

## Option 1: GitHub Actions + IBKR Cloud Connect

### Requirements:
- ✅ **Nothing!** Runs entirely in the cloud
- ✅ **IBKR account** with API access
- ✅ **GitHub repository** (you already have this)

### Setup:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/daily-capture.yml
name: Daily Account Capture

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 22 * * 1-5'  # 5 PM ET weekdays

jobs:
  capture-data:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install ib_insync pandas
    - name: Capture account data
      env:
        IBKR_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.IBKR_USERNAME }}
        IBKR_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.IBKR_PASSWORD }}
      run: python scripts/cloud_account_capture.py
    - name: Commit data
      run: |
        git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
        git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
        git add account_snapshots/
        git commit -m "📊 Daily capture $(date)" || exit 0
        git push
```

## Option 2: AWS Lambda (Professional Grade)

### Requirements:
- ✅ **AWS account** (free tier sufficient)
- ✅ **IBKR credentials** stored securely
- ✅ **Runs 24/7** without your computer

### Benefits:
- 🚀 **Always available** - never misses a capture
- 🔒 **Secure** - credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
- 💰 **Cheap** - ~$1/month for daily executions
- 📊 **Professional** - enterprise-grade reliability

## Option 3: Raspberry Pi (Set and Forget)

### Requirements:
- 💻 **Raspberry Pi** (~$50 one-time cost)
- 🌐 **Home internet connection**
- ⚡ **Always-on** mini computer

### Benefits:
- 🏠 **Local control** - your own hardware
- 💡 **Low power** - uses ~3 watts
- 🔄 **Reliable** - designed to run 24/7
- 💰 **One-time cost** - no monthly fees

## Recommendation: Start Local, Upgrade to Cloud

### Phase 1: Test Locally (This Week)
```bash
# Set up local automation first
./scripts/setup_daily_capture.sh

# Test it works when your computer is on
```

### Phase 2: Move to Cloud (Next Week)
```bash
# Deploy to GitHub Actions for reliability
# Never miss a data point again
```
