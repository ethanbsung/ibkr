description: Enforce exact implementation of strategies as described in the specified book with mandatory real data requirements.

## Core Implementation Requirements

- Follow the implementation in the book exactly. Do not make assumptions, simplifications, or optimizations unless they are explicitly stated in the book.
- All strategies must be implemented line-by-line as described in the source material. Preserve all variable names, formulas, data handling logic, and structure unless the book specifies a variation.
- Never add extra functionality, reword variable names, or 'modernize' the code unless the user requests it explicitly. Prioritize fidelity to the book above all else.
- Do not explain or justify changes unless asked. Your default behavior should be to assume the user wants faithful reproduction, not creative interpretation.
## Mandatory Real Data Implementation Standards

### 1. Real Market Data Usage
- **ALWAYS use actual market data from CSV files** (e.g., `mes_daily_data.csv`)
- **NEVER use artificial/demo data** or hardcoded example prices from the book
- Use the actual first price from the dataset (e.g., MES starts at $1,882.50, not book's demo $4,500)
- Calculate initial volatility using the actual first year of data from the dataset

### 2. Lookahead Bias Prevention
- **Volatility calculations must use only past data** available at the time of position sizing
- For day T position sizing, use volatility calculated from data up to day T-1
- Initial volatility must be calculated using only the first 256 days (or available data if less)
- **Never use future data** for current day position sizing decisions

### 3. Rolling Volatility Implementation
- Implement proper rolling volatility windows (typically 256-day for annual)
- For insufficient data periods (< window size):
  - Days 1: Use initial period volatility as fallback
  - Days 2-255: Use expanding window of all available past returns
  - Day 256+: Use proper rolling window (e.g., 256-day sliding window)
- Apply minimum volatility floor (typically 5%) to prevent position size explosions

### 4. Daily Position Updates (Dynamic Positioning)
- **Position sizes must be recalculated daily** based on:
  - Current equity (not fixed initial capital)
  - Previous day's closing price for sizing
  - Current day's volatility forecast (made from past data)
  - Current risk target
- Update equity daily: `new_equity = previous_equity * (1 + daily_percentage_return)`
- Calculate P&L using: `num_contracts * multiplier * daily_price_change * previous_price`

### 5. Data Structure Requirements
- Create analysis DataFrame starting from first valid return (after pct_change())
- Align volatility forecasts properly with return data using reindexing
- Handle NaN values gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
- Ensure price data for sizing comes from previous trading day

### 6. Blended Volatility (Chapter 3+)
- Combine short-term EWMA (32-day span) with long-term average (10-year)
- Use 70% weight for EWMA, 30% weight for long-term average
- Formula: `σ_blend = 0.3 × (Ten year average of σ_t) + 0.7 × σ_t`
- Apply minimum volatility floor consistently

### 7. Multi-Instrument Requirements (Chapter 4+)
- Load real data for all available instruments from CSV files
- Implement proper date alignment across multiple instruments
- Allow instruments to phase in as data becomes available
- Use actual instrument specifications (multipliers, costs) from instruments.csv
- Calculate Instrument Diversification Multiplier (IDM) based on actual instrument count

### 8. Performance Calculation Standards
- Use 256 business days per year consistently
- Calculate comprehensive performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, skewness)
- Ensure returns series starts from actual trading data, not initialization
- Debug zero returns by checking P&L calculation chain

### 9. Position Sizing Formulas
**Strategy 2 (Chapter 2):**
```
N = (Current_Equity × τ) ÷ (Multiplier × Price × Rolling_Volatility)
```

**Strategy 3 (Chapter 3):**
```
N = (Current_Equity × τ) ÷ (Multiplier × Price × Blended_Volatility)
```

**Strategy 4 (Chapter 4):**
```
N = (Capital × IDM × Weight × τ) ÷ (Multiplier × Price × Blended_Volatility)
```

### 10. Error Prevention Checklist
- [ ] Using real market data, not demo data
- [ ] No lookahead bias in volatility calculations
- [ ] Rolling volatility with proper fallbacks
- [ ] Daily position updates based on current equity
- [ ] Proper date alignment and NaN handling
- [ ] Minimum volatility floor applied
- [ ] P&L calculated with correct price references
- [ ] Returns series properly constructed and non-zero

## Implementation Priority Order
1. Load and validate real market data
2. Implement proper volatility calculation (no lookahead)
3. Set up daily position sizing loop
4. Calculate P&L and equity updates
5. Verify non-zero returns and performance metrics
6. Add comprehensive debugging and validation
