- **Strategy comparison tools** with visual performance attribution

## 🎯 Data Management

### Market Data Collection
- **75 futures instruments** across asset classes:
  - **Equity Indices**: ES, NQ, YM, Russell 2000
  - **Fixed Income**: Treasury bonds, notes across yield curve
  - **Commodities**: Gold, Silver, Oil, Natural Gas, Agricultural
  - **FX**: Major currency pairs (EUR, JPY, GBP, etc.)
  - **Volatility**: VIX, VSTOXX indices

### Data Quality & Validation
- **2-25 years** of historical data per instrument

## 🧪 Monte Carlo Simulation

### Methodology
- **Bootstrap resampling** with configurable block sizes
- **GARCH volatility modeling** for realistic return distributions
- **Parameter uncertainty** analysis across strategy configurations
- **Stress testing** with extreme market scenario generation

### Implementation Features
```python
# Example: Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations
num_iterations = 1000
block_size = 5  # Bootstrap block size
results = run_monte_carlo_simulation(
    strategy_returns, 
    iterations=num_iterations,
    garch_model=True
)
```

## 🔄 Paper Trading Execution

### Portfolio Management
```python
# Dynamic position sizing based on current equity
def calculate_position_size(current_equity, target_allocation_pct, 
                          price, multiplier, risk_multiplier=3.0):
    target_dollar_amount = current_equity * target_allocation_pct * risk_multiplier
    contract_value = price * multiplier
    return max(1, round(target_dollar_amount / contract_value))
```

### Strategy Allocation
- **50% IBS strategies** (12.5% each: ES, YM, GC, NQ)
- **50% Williams %R strategies** (12.5% each: ES, YM, GC, NQ)
- **Automated rebalancing** when allocation drift exceeds 5%
- **Monthly rebalancing** regardless of drift

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib ib_insync arch
```

### Interactive Brokers Setup
1. Install IB Gateway or Trader Workstation
2. Enable API connections (port 4002 for paper, 4001 for live)
3. Configure API settings and permissions

### Running the System
```bash
# Start paper trading engine
python portfolio/live_port.py

# Run backtests
python rob_port/chapter4.py

# Generate Monte Carlo analysis
python ES/ibs_monte.py

# Monitor account status
python account_summary.py
```

## 📊 Performance Visualization

The system generates comprehensive performance reports including:
- **Equity curves** with drawdown overlays
- **Strategy comparison charts** with performance attribution
- **Monte Carlo confidence intervals** for expected returns
- **Risk metrics dashboards** with Sharpe ratios and volatility analysis

## 🚨 Risk Disclosure

This is a demonstration system for educational and professional development purposes using **paper trading only - no real money is involved**. All trading is conducted in Interactive Brokers' paper trading environment with simulated funds. The strategies and code provided are for illustrative and educational purposes. While the paper trading results provide valuable insights into strategy performance, actual trading involves real financial risk and should not be undertaken without proper risk management, regulatory compliance, and thorough understanding of the strategies involved.
