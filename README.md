Welcome to the IBKR Algorithmic Trading repository! This project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and test algorithmic trading strategies using the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API. The code focuses on trading MES futures by leveraging efficient data handling, strategy development, and automation.

Features
	•	Algorithmic Strategy Implementation: Developed and tested custom trading strategies for MES futures.
	•	API Integration: Utilized the IBKR API for seamless communication with the broker’s platform.
	•	Historical Data Backtesting: Incorporated 16 years of historical data for strategy evaluation and refinement.
	•	Genetic Algorithm Optimization: Enhanced strategies by automating the parameter optimization process with genetic algorithms.
	•	Real-Time Trading: Designed for real-time execution, monitoring, and adjustments based on live market conditions.
	•	Robust Error Handling: Ensured reliability and resilience by incorporating extensive error checking and recovery mechanisms.

Technologies Used
	•	Python: Primary language for strategy development and algorithm implementation.
	•	Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
	•	Matplotlib: For visualizing backtesting results and strategy performance.
	•	IBKR API: For broker integration and real-time market data.

Project Highlights
	1.	Genetic Algorithm for Strategy Optimization:
	    •	Implemented a genetic algorithm to identify the most profitable strategies based on historical data.
	    •	Optimized parameters to maximize consistency and minimize risk.
	2.	Backtesting Framework:
	    •	Used historical data in various timeframes (1-minute to daily) to evaluate strategy performance.
	    •	Analyzed key metrics like profit factor, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.
	3.	Scalable Architecture:
	    •	Designed to handle leveraged futures trading.
	    •	Modular codebase for easy customization and addition of new strategies.
